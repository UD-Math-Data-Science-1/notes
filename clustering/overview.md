# Clustering

In supervised learning, the data samples are supplied with labels, and the goal of the learner is to generalize the examples to new values. In unsupervised learning, there are no labels. Instead, the goal is to discover structure that is intrinsically within the data itself. Common types of unsupervised algorithms are

* **Clustering** Determine whether the samples roughly divide into a small number of classes.
* **Dimension reduction** Find a reduced set of features, or create a small set of new features, that describe the data well.
* **Outlier detection** Find anomalous values in the data set, and remove them or impute replacements.

We will focus on clustering.
