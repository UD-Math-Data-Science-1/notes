    "\n",
    "9. Recall that the complete graph $K_n$ contains every possible edge on $n$ nodes. Prove that the vector $\\bfx=[1,1,\\ldots,1]$ is an eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of $K_n$. (Therefore, the eigenvector centrality is uniform over the nodes.)\n",

    "11. (Tough one!) The Watts–Strogatz construction starts with a *ring lattice* in which the nodes are arranged in a circle and each is connected to its $k$ nearest neighbors (i.e., $k/2$ on each side). Show that the clustering coefficient of an arbitrary node in the ring lattice is \n",

    "12. Prove the friendship paradox, i.e., inequality {eq}`eq-centrality-friendship-paradox`. (Hint: Start with {eq}`eq-similarity-angle` using $\\bfu=\\mathbf{d}$ and $\\bfv$ equal to a vector of all ones. Simplify the inner product, then write an equivalent inequality involving $\\onenorm{\\mathbf{d}}$ and $\\twonorm{\\mathbf{d}}$. Square both sides and show that it can be rearranged into {eq}`eq-centrality-friendship-paradox`.)"
