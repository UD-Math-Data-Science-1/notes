# Networks

Many phenomena have a natural network structure. Obvious examples are social networks, transportation networks, and the Web, but other examples include cellular protein interactions, scientific citations, ecological predation, and many others.

In mathematics, a network is represented as a **graph**. A graph is a collection of **nodes** and **edges** that connect pairs of nodes. One important distinction in graph theory is between an **undirected graph**, in which the edge $(a,b)$ is identical to $(b,a)$, and a **directed graph** or **digraph**, in which $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$ are different potential edges. In either type of graph, each edge might be labeled with a numerical value, which results in a **weighted graph**.

Undirected, unweighted graphs will give us plenty to handle, and we will not seek to go beyond them.
