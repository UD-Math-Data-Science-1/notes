    "```{figure} ../_static/svm_many.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These groups are easy to separate! In fact, as the figure shows, we are spoiled for choice, and the possibilities span a wide range, even if we use only straight lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a way to define the *best* line separating the two sets, as illustrated in this figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../_static/svm_margins.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is to define the **margin** between the sets as the maximum perpendicular distance between the points and the line. It turns out that, if the sets can be separated by a line at all, then there is a line that maximizes the margin. It's also the case that only a few of the sample points actually matter, as shown by the boxes in the figure. They are the ones that achieve the margins and are called **support vectors**. A learner based on this idea of separating data by maximum margin is called a **support vector machine** (SVM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's express the line and margin mathematically in two dimensions. We are used to writing a line as $y=mx+b$. First, though, we are going to use subscripts rather than letters for the dimensions, so make that $x_2=mx_1+b$. Next, we recall that this equation doesn't work for vertical lines (infinite slope), so we need a coefficient in front of $x_2$ as well. Rearranging, we get \n",

    "## Advanced aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other refinements too advanced for us to go into in detail here. Two stand out for making the algorithm practical for more than a trivial number of problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "One is the idea of allowing *slack*, which means that points are allowed to be on the wrong side of the dividing hyperplane, but they are punished by an amount proportional to their distance from it. The balance between maximizing margin and punishing miscreants is controlled by a hyperparameter that is usually called $C$, and the algorithm may be called **C-SVM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important refinement is to upgrade the separating hyperplane to allow other kinds of surfaces. For reasons we won't go into, this is called the **kernel trick**, and specifying the kernel is another option. The most common choices are *linear*, which is the original hyperplane as described above, and *RBF*, which has its own hyperparameter $\\gamma$ and can produce arbitrary decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage in sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore the usage of SVM with a dataset derived from images of breast tissue. The target classification is benign/malignant."
