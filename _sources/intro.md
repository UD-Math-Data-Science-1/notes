## Glossary

A much more exhaustive glossary can be found [here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/glossary-of-common-statistics-and-machine-learning-terms/).

### Git

* **Git** Protocol for maintaining the entire file history of a project, including all versions and author attributions.
* **repository** Collection of files needed to record the history of a git project.
* [**GitHub**](https://github.com) Website that hosts git repositories created by private users, along with tools to help inspect and manage them.
* **commit** Collection of particular changes to the repository made by an individual and given a message.
* **stage** Temporary designation of locally modified files to be added to the next commit.
* **merge** Automatic union of non-conflicting commits from different sources.
* **conflict** Disagreement between repository versions that requires human intervention to resolve.
* **push** Sending one or more commits from a local repository to a remote repository.
* **pull** Receiving and merging all commits from a remote repository that are unknown to the local repository.

### Notebooks

* **notebook** Self-contained collection of text, math, code, output, and graphics.
* **kernel** Back-end that executes code from and returns output to the notebook.
* **cell** Atomic unit of a notebook that contains one or more lines of text or code.
* **Markdown** Simplified syntax to put boldface, italics, and other formatting within text.
* **TeX/LaTeX** Language used to express mathematical notation within a notebook.
* **Jupyter** Popular format and system for interactive editing, execution, and export of notebooks.
* **Jupyter Lab** Layer over Jupyter notebook functionality to help manage notebooks and extensions.

### Python

* **package** (or wheel) Collection of Python files distributed in a portable way to provide extra functionality.
* **numpy** Package of essential tools for numerical computation.
* **scipy** Package of tools useful in scientific and engineering computation.
* **database** Structured collection of data, usually with a formal interface for interaction with the data.
* **data frame** Tabular representation of a data set analogous to a spreadsheet, in which columns are observable quantities and rows are different observations of the quantities.
* [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) Package for working with data frames.
* **matplotlib** Package providing plot capabilities, modeled on MATLAB.
* [**seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html) Package built on matplotlib and providing commands to simplify creating plots from data frames.
* **scikit-learn** Package that provides capabilities for machine learning using a variety of methods.
* **tensorflow**, **keras**, **pytorch** Best-known packages for machine learning using neural networks.
* **Anaconda** Bundle of Python, most of the popular Python packages, Jupyter, and other useful tools, all within an optional point-and-click interface.

### Editors/IDEs

* **PyCharm** Feature-rich freemium development environment for Python, geared toward large, complex projects.
* **VS Code** Free all-purpose editor with many extensions for working closely with git, Github, Jupyter, and Python.
* **Spyder** Free development environment that somewhat resembles MATLAB.
* **Thonny** Bare-bones development environment intended to prioritize beginners.
* **Google Colab** Free cloud-based service for jumping into Jupyter notebooks without installing any software locally.
