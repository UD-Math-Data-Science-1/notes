In **$k$-fold cross-validation**, the full data set is divided into $k$ roughly equal parts called *folds*. First, the learner is trained using folds $2,3,\\ldots,k$ and tested with the cases in fold 1. Then the learners are retrained using folds $1,3,\\ldots,k$ and tested with the cases in fold 2. This continues until each fold has served once as the test set.\n",
